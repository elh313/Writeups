# Inclusion

### Category: Web
__________________________


Based on the name I knew this would involve file inclusion. Clicking through the pages I saw that
the sites used php. One page that used php was called flag and claimed to have the flag in itâ€™s
source code. I used the folowing payload:

~~~
php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=flag
~~~

As a result the page displayed a base64-encoded string. I decoded the string and
retrieved the flag!
